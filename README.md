# Heart-Prediction-using-Multiple-Models-With-Various-Factors
This project is Heart Disease Prediction System, It preprocesses features, scales them, and trains models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression. The best model is selected based on accuracy and saved with the scaler for future predictions. ❤️💉

# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction System

## 🧠 Overview

This project aims to **predict the likelihood of heart disease** using machine learning models trained on **synthetic health data**. It demonstrates data preprocessing, model comparison, and model persistence using **Scikit-learn** and **Pickle**.

---

## 📊 Features

* 🔢 Synthetic dataset generation (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)
* ⚙️ Data preprocessing with **StandardScaler**
* 🤖 Model training with:

  * 🌲 Random Forest
  * 🚀 Gradient Boosting
  * 📈 Logistic Regression
* 🏆 Automatic best model selection based on accuracy
* 💾 Model and scaler saved as `.pkl` files for reuse

---

## 🧩 Technologies Used

* 🐍 Python
* 📦 Pandas, NumPy
* ⚙️ Scikit-learn
* 💾 Pickle

---

## 🧮 Workflow

1. **Generate** a synthetic dataset mimicking real heart health data
2. **Preprocess** and **scale** the features
3. **Train** multiple ML models
4. **Evaluate** using accuracy and classification metrics
5. **Save** the best model and scaler for deployment

---

## 📈 Results

* Automatically identifies the **best-performing model**
* Achieves strong predictive accuracy
* Creates two output files:

  * `heart_attack_model.pkl` 🧠
  * `scaler.pkl` ⚖️

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

# Run the script
python heart_disease_prediction.py
```

---

## 🩺 Future Enhancements

* Add **real-world datasets**
* Build a **Streamlit web app** for live predictions
* Include **feature importance** visualization
